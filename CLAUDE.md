## Project Overview

**GraniteFungiForager v3.5.0** is a client-side web application that provides interactive probability maps for foraging New Hampshire's official DHHS Tier 1 wild mushroom species. The application combines real-time weather data with mycological expertise to calculate county-specific foraging probabilities, with conservation-focused authentication protecting sensitive location data.

**Live Application:** https://ibelanger.github.io/GraniteFungiForager/

### Recent Enhancements (December 2025)

**Accessibility Improvements (Post v3.5.0):** The application now meets WCAG AAA accessibility standards with comprehensive contrast improvements:

- **County Map Labels:** White text with drop-shadow and stroke outline for readability on all background colors (green, brown, orange, red map states)
- **Probability Display Banner:** Forced white text with text-shadow on colored backgrounds, ensuring "King Bolete Probability: 5.2%" is always readable
- **Species Rankings Badges:** Multi-layered shadow technique for maximum contrast on all probability badges (22.0% yellow, 4.5% brown, etc.)
- **Professional UI Styling:** 244+ lines of new CSS including card-based layouts, color-coded indicators, and hover effects
- **WCAG AAA Compliance:** All text elements now achieve 7:1+ contrast ratios, making the application fully accessible and field-ready for mobile foraging

**All 468 tests passing** - accessibility enhancements are fully compatible with existing functionality.

**Research-Backed Data Integration:** The application now incorporates peer-reviewed mycological research for improved foraging accuracy:

- **Enhanced Species Data:** Added detailed research-backed fields to key species:
  - `optimalSoilTemp` - Precise temperature ranges with confidence levels and sources
  - `soilPH` - pH requirements with NH-specific notes
  - `precipitationWindow` - 30-day correlation windows vs. simple "days after rain"
  - `elevationRange` - Elevation-based phenological delays
  - `hostTreeFrequencies` - Percentage-based host tree associations
  - `phenologyNH` - NH-specific timing data
  - `confidenceLevel` - Data quality indicators (High/Medium/Low)
  - `safetyRating` - Safety classifications with critical warnings

- **Enhanced Probability Calculations:** New research-backed multipliers in `mapCalculations.js`:
  - **Oak Proximity Multiplier** - Critical for Maitake and Milk Caps (oakMandatory flag)
  - **Moss Association Multiplier** - Boosts for Black Trumpets in high-rainfall areas
  - **Species-Specific Optimal Ranges** - Precise temperature windows for each species
  - **Regional Soil pH Considerations** - NH granite soil challenges factored in

- **Primary Research Sources:**
  - MushroomExpert.com (Michael Kuo) - Species identification and ecology
  - USDA PNW-GTR-576 (Pilz et al. 2003) - Chanterelle ecology
  - Mihail 2014 McIlvainea - Morel soil temperature thresholds
  - boletes.wpamushroomclub.org - Boletus edulis complex identification
  - PMC peer-reviewed studies - Cultivation and field data

- **Species Enhanced with Research Data:**
  - Morels (Morchella spp.) - HIGH confidence
  - Chanterelles (Cantharellus cibarius complex) - HIGH confidence
  - Matsutake (Tricholoma magnivelare) - MEDIUM confidence
  - Maitake (Grifola frondosa) - HIGH confidence for oak association
  - Lobster Mushroom (Hypomyces lactifluorum) - MEDIUM-HIGH confidence
  - Milk Caps (Lactifluus volemus, L. corrugis, L. hygrophoroides) - HIGH confidence
  - Black Trumpets (Craterellus fallax) - MEDIUM-HIGH confidence

- **Future Work Noted:**
  - Toxic lookalike species data (planned for future revision)
  - GPS marking feature for perennial species like Maitake (handled in separate tool)

**All 468 tests continue to pass** - enhancements are backward-compatible and non-breaking.

- Coverage reports generated on Node 20.x
- Security audits run automatically on every push
- Multi-version Node.js compatibility ensured
- Workflow uses npm caching for faster builds (30-60s speedup)
- Matrix strategy with `fail-fast: false` continues testing all versions

## Machine Learning Pipeline

The `src/ml/accuracy-improvement-pipeline.js` contains a **completed framework** for improving prediction accuracy from 60-70% to 85-90% through:
- ✅ User success tracking and validation (`foragingReports.js` - **IMPLEMENTED**)
- ✅ iNaturalist API integration for observation data (`iNaturalistIntegration.js` - **IMPLEMENTED**)  
- ⏳ Expert validation systems (framework exists, partnerships needed)
- ⏳ Academic research integration (ongoing literature review)
- ✅ Species-specific analyzers for complex groups (Boletus, Hedgehog, etc. - **IMPLEMENTED**)

**Current Status:** All technical infrastructure is complete and deployed. The system is ready for data collection and model training once sufficient user reports are gathered.

## Important Technical Notes

### Weather API Integration
- Uses Open-Meteo API (no API key required)
- County coordinates hardcoded in `weather.js:countyTowns`
- Soil temperature calculated algorithmically from air temperature + precipitation
- Error handling for offline/API failure scenarios

### Species Data Structure
- Each species has `tempRange`, `moistureMin`, `seasonMultiplier`, and `regions` properties
- Regional probability weights for 7 NH geographic regions
- Specialized handling for subspecies groups (Boletus edulis complex, Hedgehog subgenera)

### Map Implementation
- Clean rectangular county grid (no overlapping polygons)
- Geographic accuracy: Coos → Grafton/Belknap/Carroll → Sullivan/Merrimack/Strafford → Cheshire/Hillsborough/Rockingham
- Color-coded probability visualization with smooth transitions
- Icons show geographic features (mountains 🏔️, lakes 🌊, forests 🌲, coast 🌊)
- Modern styling with Google Fonts: Crimson Pro (headers), Newsreader (body), DM Mono (code)
- Mushroom-themed aesthetic with earthy color palette

### Authentication System
- Uses simple password-based authentication (`granite2024`, `forager123`)
- Client-side only implementation suitable for conservation purposes (not high-security)
- 24-hour session persistence using localStorage with automatic cleanup
- Event-driven UI updates (`authStateChanged` custom events)
- Protected data: GPS coordinates, trail names, parking locations, contact information
- Public data: Climate information, soil types, elevation ranges, seasonal timing

### Performance Considerations
- Auto-refresh pauses when tab is not visible
- Weather data cached to prevent excessive API calls
- Modal system with proper cleanup and event management
- Responsive design optimized for mobile field use
- Authentication state managed efficiently with minimal storage footprint

## Coding Conventions & Best Practices

### Module Structure
- **ES6 Modules:** All modules use `export` and `import` statements
- **No Build Step:** Code runs directly in browser (no transpilation)
- **Global State:** Managed through exported objects (e.g., `currentWeatherData` in weather.js)
- **Event-Driven:** Custom events for cross-module communication (e.g., `authStateChanged`)

### Code Style
- **Function Documentation:** JSDoc comments for all public functions
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - camelCase for functions and variables
  - PascalCase for classes (e.g., `SimpleAuth`, `MushroomApp`)
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
- **Error Handling:** Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
- **Async/Await:** Preferred over promise chains for readability

### Testing Guidelines
- **Test Files:** Located in `tests/unit/` matching module names (e.g., `weather.test.js`)
- **Mock Data:** Shared mocks in `tests/helpers/mockData.js`
- **Coverage:** Aim for 100% coverage on new modules
- **Test Structure:** Use `describe` blocks for grouping, clear test names
- **Assertions:** Use Vitest's `expect` API with descriptive messages

### Adding New Features
1. **Create Module:** Add to `src/modules/` with clear single responsibility
2. **Write Tests First:** Create test file in `tests/unit/` before implementation
3. **Update Documentation:** Add to this CLAUDE.md file
4. **Import in app.js:** Add initialization in main application controller
5. **Run Tests:** Ensure all tests pass (`npm test`)
6. **Manual Testing:** Test in browser with `npm run dev`

### Common Patterns

#### Weather Data Access
```javascript
import { currentWeatherData, getWeatherData } from './modules/weather.js';
// Access current data
const temp = currentWeatherData.counties['Grafton'].temperature;
```

#### Authentication Checks
```javascript
import { authManager } from './modules/authentication.js';
if (authManager.isAuthenticated()) {
  // Show protected data
}
```

#### Modal Display
```javascript
import { showModal, hideModal } from './modules/interactions.js';
showModal('Title', 'Content HTML');
```
