## 🔒 **Using the Authentication System**

### **Accessing Protected Location Data**
1. **Select a species** and click on any county
2. **View general information** (freely available): climate, soil types, timing, elevation
3. **For detailed locations**: Click "🔑 Access Location Data" when you see the authentication prompt
4. **Enter password**: Use `granite2024` or `forager123`
5. **Access granted**: GPS coordinates, trail names, and detailed access information will appear

### **Why Authentication?**
- **Prevents over-harvesting** at specific GPS locations
- **Protects sensitive ecosystems** from excessive foraging pressure  
- **Maintains educational value** - general habitat info remains freely available
- **Supports conservation** - follows responsible foraging practices
- **24-hour sessions** - stay logged in for field use

### **For Developers**
- **Client-side only** - No server-side authentication required
- **Conservation-focused** - Not high-security, designed to prevent casual over-harvesting
- **Configurable passwords** - Easy to change in `src/modules/authentication.js`
- **Session management** - Automatic cleanup and expiration handling
