- **Responsible Foraging** - Protects sensitive ecological locations while maintaining educational access

### 📊 **Enhanced Data Protection**
- **Protected Information**: GPS coordinates, specific trail names, parking locations, contact details
- **Public Information**: Climate data, soil types, elevation ranges, seasonal timing, habitat descriptions
- **Two Access Passwords**: `granite2024` and `forager123` for accessing detailed location data
- **Session Management**: 24-hour authentication with automatic cleanup

## 🆕 **What's New in v3.2** (August 2024)

### 🎯 Enhanced User Experience
- **Top 5 Species Rankings** - Click any county to see the 5 most likely species with current conditions
- **Visual Condition Indicators** - See temperature, moisture, and seasonal matches at a glance
- **Improved Species Selection** - Alphabetical ordering with clear "Select a species" default
- **Fixed Tooltip System** - Single, enhanced tooltips with species-specific information

### 🍄 Expanded Species Database
- **King Bolete Complex Breakdown** - 7 individual Boletus species with distinct ecological requirements
- **29 Total Species** - Complete DHHS Tier 1 coverage plus subspecies variations

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GraniteFungiForager.git
cd GraniteFungiForager
# Open index.html in a modern browser
# Or serve with a local HTTP server for full functionality
python -m http.server 8000
```

## 🔒 **Using the Authentication System**

### **Accessing Protected Location Data**
1. **Select a species** and click on any county
2. **View general information** (freely available): climate, soil types, timing, elevation
3. **For detailed locations**: Click "🔑 Access Location Data" when you see the authentication prompt
4. **Enter password**: Use `granite2024` or `forager123`
5. **Access granted**: GPS coordinates, trail names, and detailed access information will appear

### **Why Authentication?**
- **Prevents over-harvesting** at specific GPS locations
- **Protects sensitive ecosystems** from excessive foraging pressure  
- **Maintains educational value** - general habitat info remains freely available
- **Supports conservation** - follows responsible foraging practices
- **24-hour sessions** - stay logged in for field use

### **For Developers**
- **Client-side only** - No server-side authentication required
- **Conservation-focused** - Not high-security, designed to prevent casual over-harvesting
- **Configurable passwords** - Easy to change in `src/modules/authentication.js`
- **Session management** - Automatic cleanup and expiration handling
